2. **Standardizing Seniority Levels**: Replaced terms like 'Full-time', 'Contract', and 'Temporary' in the `Seniority` column with 'Info Not Provided' for consistency.
3. **Date Conversion**: Converted `Posted` and `Collected Date` columns to datetime format for accurate date analysis.
4. **Handling Missing Values**: Filled `NaN` values in `Employees` and `Applicants` columns with zeros to ensure completeness.
5. **Data Type Conversion**: Converted `Employees` and `Applicants` columns from float to integer type for consistency.
6. **Duplicate Removal**: Removed duplicate roles posted by the same company in multiple countries, reducing remote job entries from 3% to 2.3%.

#### Analytical Methods

Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and keyword analysis were used to interpret the data.
