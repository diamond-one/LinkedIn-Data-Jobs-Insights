Join us in the global movement for climate action through data-driven soil carbon sequestration. Soils are the unsung hero in the fight against climate change. With your help we want to uncover and use this secret. As data engineer at Seqana you will acquire and harmonize data on soils to unlock the potential of soil carbon sequestration for climate protection.

About Seqana:

Seqana is an EU- and venture-backed start-up building monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) tools to drive soil carbon sequestration and the transition towards regenerative and climate-preserving agriculture.

One of the most powerful (and underutilized) solutions to climate change is capturing carbon in soils via regenerative agricultural practices. This approach has the potential for several times more climate impact than planting forests, while also providing extensive co-benefits such as erosion mitigation and improved water quality, food security, and biodiversity.

Existing solutions for MRV for the carbon market are one of the main drivers of cost and effort, and often the limiting factor for new project development. At Seqana, we combine satellite imagery, our extensive proprietary library of soil datasets, and machine learning to provide an accurate, cost-effective, and efficient MRV solution for soil organic carbon. Our product enables project developers, large corporations and NGOS with a scalable solution to measure and quantify the impact of their regenerative agricultural practices on soil carbon sequestration, enabling them to report credible CO2 reductions.

Tasks

Our growing team is looking for an ambitious and driven data engineer to help us quantify soil organic carbon and its sequestration by using better data. You will play a crucial part in developing and maintaining our data infrastructure, ensuring the seamless integration and processing of large-scale datasets. Your work will directly contribute to the advancement of our MRV tools, helping to drive effective climate solutions through innovative technology. We're looking for someone who brings an analytical mindset, and data engineering skills, as well as an interest in environmental sciences and data analysis. You will be part of a passionate team that aims to have a direct positive impact on the world. We value proactivity, authenticity, creativity, and empathy in our company culture.

Design, build, test, and maintain scalable databases and ETL/ELT pipelines for diverse datasets, including satellite and soil data 
Manage the onboarding of new datasets and implement rigorous data quality processes
Build trusted and scalable data models to support our ML initiatives and MRV products
Standardize our data discovery, acquisition, and harmonization processes
Develop analytical data models and dashboards to serve the needs of insights and analytics
Collaborate with stakeholders across the company to constantly optimize the data infrastructure and associated processes.


Requirements

What you bring:

2-4 years of experience in data engineering / science roles, including practical experience building databases / data models and ETL processes (SQL, dbt, Python)
Solid understanding of relational databases, schema design and data quality processes, preferably in the context of MLOps and development.
Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and their data services
Practical experience creating dashboards and analytics for technical and/or business insights 
Ability to work and communicate effectively in an agile, fast-paced startup environment
A proactive, can-do attitude with the ability to quickly adapt, learn, and embrace change
Passion for environmental sustainability and climate tech


What makes you stand out:

Bonus: Experience with geospatial data (especially environmental and/or satellite data), software (PostGIS, GeoPandas, GDAL) or soil science is a big plus.
Bonus: Experience with ML development and MLOps, including model training, deployment, and monitoring is a big plus.

Benefits

Benefits you can expect:

Be part of our highly motivated, committed, and international team with flat hierarchies that is working on solving one of societies‚Äô biggest challenges: Climate Change

Leasen: het is meer dan een auto afhalen. Het is een samenwerking die allerlei vormen en maten aan kan nemen, met verschillende wensen bij elke afspraak. Je kunt hierin heel veel aanbieden, en dat is wat ze hier doen. Maar klantvriendelijk zijn vraagt om goede collega‚Äôs.

Wat doen ze hier?

Leasen is lang niet voor iedereen hetzelfde. De ene organisatie wil een volledig wagenpark, de ander wil een enkele heftruck. Ieders eisen, wensen en budget zijn anders en daar is service voor nodig. Flexibiliteit is iets waar het bij veel leasepartijen nog aan ontbreekt, maar dat is niet overal het geval.

Hier hebben ze meer dan je gebruikelijke auto van de zaak. Deze organisatie is echt een partner voor operationele, financi√´le √©n equipment lease. Je kunt hier inderdaad ‚Äògewoon‚Äô een wagenpark opzetten, maar ook een heftruck leasen. Afhankelijk van de precieze wensen van de aanvraag kunnen ze van product tot service en oplevering helemaal met je meedenken. Daardoor hebben ze al jaren stevige groeicijfers.

Mooi! En wat kan mijn rol hier worden?

Als Data Engineer haal jij de beste customer insights naar boven. Je focus ligt echt op de klantdata, en je analyseert welke ontwikkelingen nodig zijn om de klanttevredenheid effectiever en effici√´nter te verhogen. Hiervoor gebruik je de vrijheid om je kennis en ervaring te gebruiken binnen het CX team. Binnen dat team is het doel om dagelijks impact de maken op de klantervaring, en dat kan niet zonder jou.

Kennis en ervaring gebruiken, zei je?

Hiermee bedoelen we in ieder geval twee jaar werkervaring in data. Als je ervaring hebt met Customer Experience heb je extra voordeel maar dat is niet verplicht. Met een sterk analytisch vermogen en oog voor detail glippen er geen kansen tussen jouw vingers door. Werken in een team versterkt jouw productiviteit en inspelen op de wensen van een klant is voor jou de norm. Bovendien spreek en schrijf je vloeiend Nederlands.

Check, check en check. En wat krijg ik ervoor terug?

Het maandsalaris start op ‚Ç¨5.000,- maar kan zo oplopen als je wat ervaring hebt. Vakantiegeld en pensioenregeling komen hier nog bij en de collectieve zorgverzekering staat voor je klaar. De kilometervergoeding is 21 cent en thuiswerkvergoeding is aanwezig voor als je liever weinig reist. Klaar om aan de bak te gaan? We gaan graag met je in gesprek!"""

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We‚Äôre not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We‚Äôre a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare‚Äôs enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here‚Äôs the deal - we don‚Äôt store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Sound like something you‚Äôd like to be a part of? We‚Äôd love to hear from you!

Bij JUVO zijn mensen, data en technologie de kern van ons bestaan. Onze consultants zijn experts in hun vakgebied en zorgen dat projecten bij onze klanten in goede banen geleid worden. 

Onze activiteiten splitsen we op in 3 Business Units. Als Data Engineer kom je terecht in onze BU Data waar we een breed scala aan diensten bieden ‚Äì van consultancy opdrachten bij onze klanten tot interne projecten in eigen beheer. We zijn experts in Data Engineering, BI, Data analyse & architectuur, Data visualisatie en Data Strategie. Daardoor kunnen we onze klanten volledig ondersteunen in hun data-noden. Dit hebben we al gedaan voor klanten zoals Port of Antwerp, Luminus, Nike, ASML, Ravago, ‚Ä¶ 

Onze klanten kunnen we opdelen in 2 grote regio‚Äôs. Antwerpen/Brussel/Limburg/Vlaams-Brabant en Oost-Vlaanderen/West-Vlaanderen/Brussel. Wat wil zeggen dat je kan kiezen in welke van de 2 regio‚Äôs je het liefst werkt. We zorgen voor een goede work-life balans, waar je mag rekenen op 2 tot 3 dagen thuiswerk.

Onze HQ kan je trouwens vinden in het mooie en gezellige Herentals. 

EEN WEEK IN HET LEVEN VAN‚Ä¶ 

Hoe ziet het takenpakket van onze consultants er nu uit? We schetsen hieronder de werkweek van onze collega Nathan ‚Äì Data Engineer bij JUVO en sinds 2021 bij ons aan de slag. 

Maandag start de dag om 8u met het checken van mijn mailbox. Daarna ga ik na of alle ETL pipelines over het weekend goed gedraaid hebben en of ergens een correctie of interventie nodig is. Om 9u30 volgt een daily standup (DSU) waar we met de collega‚Äôs gaan kijken wat er nog openstaat en waaraan iedereen die dag zal werken. 
Dinsdag staat er een Business Unit namiddag op het programma met de JUVO collega‚Äôs. Deze keer gaat het door op de Corda campus in Hasselt. We werken samen aan een hackaton rond de implementatie van rapportages met DBT en PowerBI. We steken allemaal de handen uit de bouwen en presenteren achteraf onze resultaten. Afsluiten doen we met de JUVO kwartaalmeeting, gevolgd door een hapje & drankje. 
Woensdag heb ik een meeting met een business persoon van de klant. We bespreken een nieuwe ETL pipeline die bijkomende inzichten moet genereren in het onkostenproces. Ik verzamel requirements en schets een functioneel beeld van hoe alles werkt, welke systemen betrokken zijn en welke data precies ontsloten moet worden. Daarna kan de technische analyse gebeuren. 
Donderdag werk ik vanop het kantoor van de klant. Er is veel interactie met de collega‚Äôs ‚Äì vragen worden gesteld, problemen worden besproken en oplossingen geformuleerd. Om 17u00 heb ik afgesproken met een paar collega‚Äôs en sluiten we de dag af met een ontspannend spelletje padel.
Vrijdag starten we zoals steeds met onze DSU waar we de status van onze tickets overlopen. Daarna volledige focus op mijn taken van die dag. Tussendoor nog een korte meeting over de technische requirements van een nieuwe ETL implementatie. Het einde van de werkdag nadert en dan kijk ik of de data pipelines goed lopen. Daarna kan het weekend beginnen!

Je hebt kennis van CI/CD en DevOps tools en concepten.
Je hebt ervaring met √©√©n of meerdere cloud platformen.
Kennis of ervaring met ruimtelijke informatie en de specifieke uitdagingen die de verwerking van locatiedata zo typeren zijn een plus.


Dit krijg je van ons 

In ruil voor je precisie en professionaliteit geven we je een boeiende job in een nog boeiender, vooruitstrevend en groeiend bedrijf. En dat in een bedrijfscultuur die verantwoordelijkheidszin en innovatie stimuleert! Geen enkele dag is dezelfde, maar groeien en bijleren doe je altijd.

What is Amplemarket all about?

Amplemarket's premise is that a lot of the playbooks used by B2B sales teams that worked 5 years ago don't cut it anymore.

In today's environment, sales teams need to have a tremendous amount of information about their prospects to decide when is the best moment and channel to reach out in the most relevant way. You can't do this with 5 different data/sales enablement point solutions that don't share the same data schema and barely communicate with each other. Amplemarket is the all-in-one compound solution that enables this.

Our AI-powered sales platform helps B2B companies generate more opportunities thanks to our advanced lead generation engine, hyper-personalized sequencing, omnichannel outreach, and AI-powered smart actions. We are backed by Y Combinator, and we are powering the sales teams at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world like Deel, Moveworks, H1 and Vanta.

Important Notice: Beware of Recruitment Scams

It has come to our attention that there are fraudulent activities targeting job seekers, where individuals are impersonating Amplemarket by using fake profiles, domains, and emails.

Please be informed that Amplemarket always uses our main domain (amplemarket.com) for all hiring and recruitment purposes. Any communication or offer not originating from an amplemarket.com email address should be regarded as suspicious.

We will never request personal financial information (such as bank account details) during the initial application or interview process.
Our hiring process does not involve transferring money or making payments of any kind to secure a position.

Amplemarket is not responsible for any loss or damage incurred as a result of job scams or fraudulent activity by third parties misusing our company name.

If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a job opportunity with Amplemarket, please contact our HR department directly.

We advise you to verify the authenticity of any job-related communications claiming to be from Amplemarket. If you have any concerns or doubts, please contact us directly through our official channels.

Your security is our priority. Thank you for your vigilance and understanding.

Are you up for a challenge? Amplemarket welcomes spontaneous applications from talented people who are eager to join our team.

We are always on the lookout for exceptional Data Engineers who want to revolutionize the future of sales, while thriving in an incredible Engineering environment.

While we may not be prioritizing this opening at the moment - and, therefore, might take a bit longer to get back to you - we review spontaneous applications regularly and if your profile stands out, we'll definitely want to get to know you üôÇ

Do you have experience with writing code to ingest data? Do you like data wrangling, digging into data sources, and processing data to a readable and usable state? Do you love that feeling of accomplishment when data is flowing seamlessly into a data lake, day in day out, hour after hour, based on code that you have carefully crafted? Then this Data Engineer job is just what you are looking for!

We need your expertise

For multiple enterprise customers we create data connectors to make data flow from various sources, using state-of-the art technologies and cloud providers like Azure. But we are agnostic and do not shy away from any technical implementation. What they all have in common, is that the data is part of the business value chain and will be used in a production environment, so data quality, continuity and seamless flow are crucial ‚Äì of course with monitoring for disruptions.

Activities
Create data connectors or processing solutions, using Python or other coding languages.
Define validation tests to run in the data pipeline.
Define monitoring and alerting to ensure visibility when the data flow is interrupted or corrupted.
If incidents occur, you take the lead in getting to the root cause as soon as possible to solve the incident with as little impact on the end users as possible.
Interact and validate with end users for the solutions you build, aiming for continuous improvement.
You and the team are responsible for building, deploying, maintaining, and optimizing the data flow solution.

This is what we offer

You will be given the opportunity to develop in the best way possible, under the personal guidance of fellow data engineers and architects of Itility. We have several trainings available in our own Itility Academy to help you develop your hard & soft skills. But also an active community that organizes tech hours to share knowledge, demo solutions and new tools.
In addition to a competitive salary, you will receive extras such as:

26 vacation days
115 euros cost allowance
Lease car or mobility allowance
50% health insurance contribution
60% retirement plan contribution
Performance based bonus
Laptop and phone
Itility Academy - hard & soft skills training
Hybrid working

This is you

You are familiar with the scrum/agile way-of-working and in software practices that enable a professional data flow. Further requirements:
You have a bachelor‚Äôs or master‚Äôs degree.
You have experience creating data ingestion scripts.
Experience with Azure is a pre.
You have 2 ‚Äì 3 years of relevant work experience.
You have a good understanding of SQL and Python.
You are a team player and you have good communication skills.
Ideally, you have worked with data platforms and data lakes within an enterprise environment.
Screening is part of the hiring procedure.

Welcome to Blue Radix
Blue Radix is the AI-specialist and market leader on autonomous greenhouse management in the international horticulture market.

Artefact, ein globales KI- und Datenberatungsunternehmen mit rasantem Wachstum, sucht eine:n kommunikative:n, innovative:n Data Engineer (m/w/d) f√ºr das Tech-Team in Vollzeit. Wirst du das sein?

Unser Data Engineering Team verwandelt ein breites Spektrum an technischer Expertise in L√∂sungen, die jahrelang genutzt werden k√∂nnen und f√ºr unsere Kunden echten Mehrwert bringen. Du wirst Erfahrungen im Umgang mit Kunden und nichttechnischen Personen sammeln und die Auswirkung deiner Arbeit in der Praxis sehen.

Welche Aufgaben du bei uns √ºbernimmst:

Du hilfst dabei, Datenpipelines einzurichten, zu implementieren und zu pflegen. Die meisten unserer Aufgaben drehen sich um Datenpipelines, obwohl wir in verschiedenen Stadien des Lebenszyklus eingreifen k√∂nnen, von der Erstellung einer Datenplattform von Grund auf, √ºber die Umstellung auf neue Datenarchitekturen bis hin zur √úberpr√ºfung der Sicherheit einer bestehenden Einrichtung usw.
Du wirst ein breites Spektrum an Erfahrungen im Bereich Data Engineering sammeln. Es wird von dir erwartet, dass du an einigen Missionen pro Jahr (1-3) mitarbeitest, bei denen du verschiedene Branchen, Anwendungsf√§lle und Technologien kennen lernst. Selbst innerhalb einer Mission k√∂nnen deine t√§glichen Aufgaben sehr unterschiedlich sein!
Du wirst sehen, welche Auswirkungen deine Arbeit in der realen Welt hat. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Unternehmen, die sich auf Vapor Ware spezialisiert haben, bauen wir L√∂sungen, die jahrelang genutzt werden k√∂nnen und f√ºr unsere Kunden tats√§chlich etwas bewirken. Das bedeutet auch, dass du Erfahrungen im Umgang mit Kunden und nicht-technischen Menschen sammeln wirst.
Du wirst mit hochmodernen Tools arbeiten. Unser Stack variiert von Kunde zu Kunde, ist aber im Allgemeinen recht modern - GCP mit Terraform, DBT und Vertex AI, um nur ein aktuelles Beispiel zu nennen. In der Regel verwenden wir jedoch Python als Programmiersprache.

Was du mitbringst:

Du beherrschst eine Programmiersprache (vorzugsweise Python, aber es kann auch C++, Java usw. sein). Wenn diese Sprache nicht Python ist, m√ºssen wir sicher sein, dass du sie leicht erlernen kannst.
Neben deinen Programmierkenntnissen verf√ºgst du √ºber eine echte Datenkultur: Du kennst dich mit ETL-Workflows und Datenbankkonzepten aus
Du verf√ºgst √ºber sehr gute SQL-Kenntnisse und bist in der Lage, leistungsstarke und effiziente Abfragen zu schreiben.
Du hast ausgezeichnete Probleml√∂sungsf√§higkeiten und lernst schnell.
Du kannst in einem Team von Programmierern arbeiten: Du wei√üt, wie man Git benutzt, du kannst Unit- und Integrationstests schreiben, du kannst deinen Kollegen deine Arbeit klar erkl√§ren, du wei√üt, wie man nach externen Ressourcen sucht und um Hilfe bittet, usw.

‚ÄúNice-to-haves‚Äù
Wir erwarten nicht, dass du alle diese Anforderungen erf√ºllst, aber du solltest zumindest ein paar davon mitbringen:

Du hast neben deinen Software-Engineering-F√§higkeiten auch einen Data-Science-Hintergrund und bist in der Lage, eine Art Hybridprofil zwischen Data Scientist und Data Engineer zu sein.
Du hast Erfahrung in der Arbeit an Produktionssystemen oder mit Kundendaten.
Du hast bereits in Agile/Scrum-Umgebungen gearbeitet und kennst dich mit Tools wie Jira aus.
Du hast bereits Erfahrung mit dem Aufbau von Datenpipelines f√ºr ML/AI-Projekte und nutzt Technologien wie Airflow, Spark, LangChain usw.
Du kennst dich gut mit Datenbanksystemen aus und wei√üt, wie man sie am besten f√ºr bestimmte Datenverwendungszwecke einrichtet.
Du bist ein angehender MLOps-Experte und wei√üt, wie man Machine-Learning-Modelle in der Produktion verwaltet und √ºberwacht.
Du hast umfangreiche Erfahrung mit Cloud-Umgebungen (AWS, Azure, GCP). Bonuspunkte gibt es, wenn du mit den Data-Engineering-Komponenten dieser Cloud-Umgebungen gearbeitet hast (Dataflow / Vertex AI / Dataproc, Sagemaker, HDInsight, Databricks, etc.)
Du kennst dich mit Netzwerken und Sicherheitskonzepten aus.

üí™‚Ää Ce qui fait notre force ?

üîπ Achieve greatness - Notre culture est digital native. 

L‚Äôagilit√© est au c≈ìur de notre fonctionnement. On s‚Äôest inspir√©s des pratiques des entreprises Digital Natives pour construire notre succ√®s : agilit√©, rapidit√© dans les prises de d√©cision, organisation d√©centralis√©e, promotion et utilisation de l‚ÄôOpen Source, etc.

üîπ Proud to be developers - Notre strat√©gie est co-construite, par les Techs pour les Techs.

La direction g√©n√©rale et la direction de chaque agence sont co-lead√©es par 2 Managing Directors : Business & Engineering

Individuellement, chaque d√©veloppeur et d√©veloppeuse reporte √† un Engineering Manager. Ce dernier est lui-m√™me d√©veloppeur et a du temps d√©di√© pour manager. Il travaille √©troitement avec le Business pour proposer les missions les plus adapt√©es √† chacun.

Ce qui nous rassemble aussi, c‚Äôest notre envie de contribuer √† la communaut√© et √† l‚Äôentreprise.

On a une hi√©rarchie tr√®s plate : on croit que l‚Äôentreprise est plus performante quand elle favorise l‚Äôautonomie et l‚Äôintelligence collective.

Tu t‚Äôattendais √† ce qu‚Äôon te parle d‚Äô√©tudes, de dipl√¥mes ou d‚Äôexp√©rience, dans cette section‚ÄØ? Chez SFEIR, on n‚Äôa qu‚Äôun seul crit√®re : c‚Äôest ton niveau technique et ta culture tech. On en reparle un peu plus bas !

Au-del√† de ta ma√Ætrise de Python ou Scala et de l'√©cosyst√®me Data (ex : Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, ‚Ä¶) tu es quelqu'un de curieux(se) et dans le partage !

@Audrey , @Cl√©ment , @Samar & @Siham , nos super Account Managers, seront √† ton √©coute pour d√©finir avec toi le projet id√©al et tu pourras en changer lorsque tu en auras fait le tour.

üöÄ Et si je souhaite √©voluer ?

Une fois que tu as fait le tour de ton poste, voil√† diff√©rents r√¥les que tu pourrais prendre chez SFEIR (mais ce n'est pas une obligation) :

üîπ Si tu veux rester 100% Tech : les Staff Engineer sont des r√©f√©rents techniques dans leur domaine et consacrent entre 1 et 4 jours par semaine √† la communaut√©, en diffusant du savoir technique : formations, conseil aux managers, r√©ponse aux appels d‚Äôoffres avec l‚Äô√©quipe commerciale, ‚Ä¶

üîπ Si tu veux t‚Äôorienter vers du Management : Les Engineering Managers sont les r√©f√©rents des D√©veloppeurs en mission. Tu serais leur coach pour les aider √† se sentir bien dans leur job, les faire grandir et suivre leur carri√®re.

üí∞ Combien tu vas gagner chez SFEIR ?

Chez nous, pas de grille de salaire fig√©e dans le marbre ! Cependant, il est important pour nous de garder une homog√©n√©it√© entre les salari√©(e)s en se basant sur les comp√©tences et le march√© actuel.

On pourra t‚Äôen dire plus d√®s que tu auras pass√© notre process de recrutement technique, les PlayOffs, car les salaires que nous proposons ne prennent pas en compte ton √¢ge, tes dipl√¥mes ou ton background. Tes comp√©tences, rien que tes comp√©tences !

üíª‚Ää Pr√©sentiel ou t√©l√©travail ?

Les deux, mon capitaine !

On s‚Äôadapte √† nos clients, mais la plupart sont en hybride. On se doit simplement de respecter la limite l√©gale pour les frontaliers.

üëã‚Ää ‚ÄúJe suis int√©ress√©(e), comment vous rejoindre ?‚Äù

Si cette annonce a attir√© ton attention, il ne te reste plus qu'√† postuler !

Max 2 jours apr√®s les PlayOffs, on revient vers toi pour te d√©briefer, et :

üîπ Soit, on te dit sur quels aspects tu peux encore progresser et on te donne des billes pour que tu puisses retenter ta chance apr√®s un peu de pratique ;

üîπ Soit, on te fait une proposition d‚Äôembauche.

Join us in the global movement for climate action through data-driven soil carbon sequestration. Soils are the unsung hero in the fight against climate change. With your help we want to uncover and use this secret. As data engineer at Seqana you will acquire and harmonize data on soils to unlock the potential of soil carbon sequestration for climate protection.

About Seqana:

Seqana is an EU- and venture-backed start-up building monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) tools to drive soil carbon sequestration and the transition towards regenerative and climate-preserving agriculture.

One of the most powerful (and underutilized) solutions to climate change is capturing carbon in soils via regenerative agricultural practices. This approach has the potential for several times more climate impact than planting forests, while also providing extensive co-benefits such as erosion mitigation and improved water quality, food security, and biodiversity.

Existing solutions for MRV for the carbon market are one of the main drivers of cost and effort, and often the limiting factor for new project development. At Seqana, we combine satellite imagery, our extensive proprietary library of soil datasets, and machine learning to provide an accurate, cost-effective, and efficient MRV solution for soil organic carbon. Our product enables project developers, large corporations and NGOS with a scalable solution to measure and quantify the impact of their regenerative agricultural practices on soil carbon sequestration, enabling them to report credible CO2 reductions.

Tasks

Our growing team is looking for an ambitious and driven data engineer to help us quantify soil organic carbon and its sequestration by using better data. You will play a crucial part in developing and maintaining our data infrastructure, ensuring the seamless integration and processing of large-scale datasets. Your work will directly contribute to the advancement of our MRV tools, helping to drive effective climate solutions through innovative technology. We're looking for someone who brings an analytical mindset, and data engineering skills, as well as an interest in environmental sciences and data analysis. You will be part of a passionate team that aims to have a direct positive impact on the world. We value proactivity, authenticity, creativity, and empathy in our company culture.

Impact you‚Äôll own:

Design, build, test, and maintain scalable databases and ETL/ELT pipelines for diverse datasets, including satellite and soil data 
Manage the onboarding of new datasets and implement rigorous data quality processes
Build trusted and scalable data models to support our ML initiatives and MRV products
Standardize our data discovery, acquisition, and harmonization processes
Develop analytical data models and dashboards to serve the needs of insights and analytics
Collaborate with stakeholders across the company to constantly optimize the data infrastructure and associated processes.


Requirements

What you bring:

2-4 years of experience in data engineering / science roles, including practical experience building databases / data models and ETL processes (SQL, dbt, Python)
Solid understanding of relational databases, schema design and data quality processes, preferably in the context of MLOps and development.
Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and their data services
Practical experience creating dashboards and analytics for technical and/or business insights 
Ability to work and communicate effectively in an agile, fast-paced startup environment
A proactive, can-do attitude with the ability to quickly adapt, learn, and embrace change
Passion for environmental sustainability and climate tech


What makes you stand out:

Bonus: Experience with geospatial data (especially environmental and/or satellite data), software (PostGIS, GeoPandas, GDAL) or soil science is a big plus.
Bonus: Experience with ML development and MLOps, including model training, deployment, and monitoring is a big plus.
Bonus: Practical experience with orchestration tools (e.g. Airflow) is a plus.


Benefits

Benefits you can expect:

Leasen: het is meer dan een auto afhalen. Het is een samenwerking die allerlei vormen en maten aan kan nemen, met verschillende wensen bij elke afspraak. Je kunt hierin heel veel aanbieden, en dat is wat ze hier doen. Maar klantvriendelijk zijn vraagt om goede collega‚Äôs.

Wat doen ze hier?

Leasen is lang niet voor iedereen hetzelfde. De ene organisatie wil een volledig wagenpark, de ander wil een enkele heftruck. Ieders eisen, wensen en budget zijn anders en daar is service voor nodig. Flexibiliteit is iets waar het bij veel leasepartijen nog aan ontbreekt, maar dat is niet overal het geval.

Hier hebben ze meer dan je gebruikelijke auto van de zaak. Deze organisatie is echt een partner voor operationele, financi√´le √©n equipment lease. Je kunt hier inderdaad ‚Äògewoon‚Äô een wagenpark opzetten, maar ook een heftruck leasen. Afhankelijk van de precieze wensen van de aanvraag kunnen ze van product tot service en oplevering helemaal met je meedenken. Daardoor hebben ze al jaren stevige groeicijfers.

Mooi! En wat kan mijn rol hier worden?

Als Data Engineer haal jij de beste customer insights naar boven. Je focus ligt echt op de klantdata, en je analyseert welke ontwikkelingen nodig zijn om de klanttevredenheid effectiever en effici√´nter te verhogen. Hiervoor gebruik je de vrijheid om je kennis en ervaring te gebruiken binnen het CX team. Binnen dat team is het doel om dagelijks impact de maken op de klantervaring, en dat kan niet zonder jou.

Kennis en ervaring gebruiken, zei je?

Hiermee bedoelen we in ieder geval twee jaar werkervaring in data. Als je ervaring hebt met Customer Experience heb je extra voordeel maar dat is niet verplicht. Met een sterk analytisch vermogen en oog voor detail glippen er geen kansen tussen jouw vingers door. Werken in een team versterkt jouw productiviteit en inspelen op de wensen van een klant is voor jou de norm. Bovendien spreek en schrijf je vloeiend Nederlands.

Check, check en check. En wat krijg ik ervoor terug?

Het maandsalaris start op ‚Ç¨5.000,- maar kan zo oplopen als je wat ervaring hebt. Vakantiegeld en pensioenregeling komen hier nog bij en de collectieve zorgverzekering staat voor je klaar. De kilometervergoeding is 21 cent en thuiswerkvergoeding is aanwezig voor als je liever weinig reist. Klaar om aan de bak te gaan? We gaan graag met je in gesprek!"""

Solitas oleme andmetega t√∂√∂tanud pea 30 aastat ja praegu t√∂√∂tab Solita √ºheksas riigis asuvates kontorites √ºle 700 andmespetsialisti. Loome klientidele andmelahendusi, kasutades just nende vajadustega k√µige paremini sobivat t√§nap√§evast tehnoloogiat. K√µige olulisemad komponendid meie andmeprojektides on pilvep√µhised andmebaasid ja andmesalvestusmeetodid nagu Snowflake, Databricks, DBT, Redshift, Semarchy jne, mille valime vastavalt projekti ja kliendi vajadustele. Arendame andmearhitektuuri, l√§htudes modernsetest tehnoloogiatest ja kasutades agiilset arendusmetoodikat.

Loome lahendusi nii era- kui ka avaliku sektori klientidele.

Meie motoks on ‚ÄûImpact that lasts‚Äú. Solita projektides on √ºhendatud tarkvara arendus, andmed, pilveteenused ja teenusedisain.

Solita s√ºdameasi on luua v√µimalusi oskuste arendamiseks olenemata sellest, kui kogenud juba oled. Andmeinsenerina on sinu √ºlesanne kavandada ja rakendada tehnilisi lahendusi, mis h√µlmavad n√§iteks andmete modelleerimist ja integreerimist, andmeladusid ja pilvep√µhiseid andmete laadimise s√ºsteeme.

Kasuks tuleb

Eriti suureks kasuks tuleb m√µne pilvetehnoloogia tundmine (AWS, Azure v√µi GCP).
Suure eelise annab versioonihalduse ja CI/CD tundmine. 


Mida meie pakume 

Paindlikku t√∂√∂aega ja v√§ga palju vabadust ise oma t√∂√∂d organiseerida.
P√µhjalikku sisseelamisprogrammi, mis h√µlmab koolitusi vajalike andmetehnoloogiate osas.

Sinu roll ei pea p√ºsima aastast aastasse muutumatuna. Meil on toimiv spetsialistide rotatsiooni s√ºsteem ja paljud Solita t√∂√∂tajad on oma karj√§√§ri jooksul Solitas t√§itnud mitmesuguseid rolle.
Saad m√µjutada tehnoloogiaid ja meetodeid, mida projektides kasutame.
Pakume inimesekeskset t√∂√∂keskkonda, kus kantakse √ºksteise eest hoolt.
Tahame olla kindlad, et sinu t√∂√∂- ja eraelu on heas tasakaalus. Just seda peavad meie t√∂√∂tajad Solita √ºheks suurimaks plussiks.

T√∂√∂koha asukoht: Tallinn/Tartu. Kasutame h√ºbriidmeetodit ehk kel soovi, t√∂√∂tab kontoris, kes eelistab kodukontorit, see t√∂√∂tab kodust. Kontorisse palume vahel tulla m√µneks kohtumiseks v√µi √ºrituseks.

Usume siiralt, et k√µik, mis meil on, tuleb meie inimestelt

Investeerime mitmel moel oskuste arendamisse ‚Äì kogemuste jagamisest laiahaardelisemate koolituste korraldamiseni. Samuti toetame oma t√∂√∂tajate heaolu, pakkudes neile ulatuslikku soodustuste paketti nii t√∂√∂tegemiseks kui ka vaba aja veetmiseks.

Soodustame eksperimenteerimist ja iseseisvust

Usume iseseisvusse t√∂√∂tamisel ‚Äì sul on vabadus valida, mida sa teed, ja vastutus tehtu l√µpule viia. Hoolivus, pingevaba √µhkkond, julgus ja kirg on olnud meie v√§√§rtused pikka aega ning need kirjeldavad endiselt h√§sti, mida t√§hendab kuulumine Solita kogukonda.

Kas pakub huvi?

Saada meile oma CV ning kirjuta meile endast ja oma taustast veidi l√§hemalt. Soovime sind tundma √µppida ja √ºheskoos v√§lja selgitada, mis meie m√µlema jaoks k√µige paremini toimida v√µiks.

Peale Eesti tegutseb Solita Soomes, Rootsis, Taanis, Norras, Belgias, Poolas, ≈†veitsis ja Saksamaal ning teeb koost√∂√∂d maailma √ºhtede suurimate ettev√µtete ja riiklike organisatsioonidega.

Kuidas on Solitas t√∂√∂tada, p√§riselt? Saku v√µtab selle 57 sekundiga kokku siin, ja Sanna siin."""

EEN WEEK IN HET LEVEN VAN‚Ä¶ 

Hoe ziet het takenpakket van onze consultants er nu uit? We schetsen hieronder de werkweek van onze collega Nathan ‚Äì Data Engineer bij JUVO en sinds 2021 bij ons aan de slag. 

Maandag start de dag om 8u met het checken van mijn mailbox. Daarna ga ik na of alle ETL pipelines over het weekend goed gedraaid hebben en of ergens een correctie of interventie nodig is. Om 9u30 volgt een daily standup (DSU) waar we met de collega‚Äôs gaan kijken wat er nog openstaat en waaraan iedereen die dag zal werken. 
Dinsdag staat er een Business Unit namiddag op het programma met de JUVO collega‚Äôs. Deze keer gaat het door op de Corda campus in Hasselt. We werken samen aan een hackaton rond de implementatie van rapportages met DBT en PowerBI. We steken allemaal de handen uit de bouwen en presenteren achteraf onze resultaten. Afsluiten doen we met de JUVO kwartaalmeeting, gevolgd door een hapje & drankje. 
Woensdag heb ik een meeting met een business persoon van de klant. We bespreken een nieuwe ETL pipeline die bijkomende inzichten moet genereren in het onkostenproces. Ik verzamel requirements en schets een functioneel beeld van hoe alles werkt, welke systemen betrokken zijn en welke data precies ontsloten moet worden. Daarna kan de technische analyse gebeuren. 
Donderdag werk ik vanop het kantoor van de klant. Er is veel interactie met de collega‚Äôs ‚Äì vragen worden gesteld, problemen worden besproken en oplossingen geformuleerd. Om 17u00 heb ik afgesproken met een paar collega‚Äôs en sluiten we de dag af met een ontspannend spelletje padel.
Vrijdag starten we zoals steeds met onze DSU waar we de status van onze tickets overlopen. Daarna volledige focus op mijn taken van die dag. Tussendoor nog een korte meeting over de technische requirements van een nieuwe ETL implementatie. Het einde van de werkdag nadert en dan kijk ik of de data pipelines goed lopen. Daarna kan het weekend beginnen!

Data Engineer met voorliefde voor location intelligence? Join us!
In de ban van big data? Spreekt location- of spatial intelligence je bovendien aan? Dan moeten we praten. 
 
Dit doe jij als Data Engineer Location Intelligence 

Ter uitbreiding van ons team zoeken we een Data Engineer. En niet zomaar √©√©n! We willen graag een data wrangler die er niet voor terugdeinst om zijn skills verder te ontwikkelen. Dat kan binnen dit geweldige takenpakket:
Je ontwerpt nieuwe data architecturen √©n verbetert de bestaande. Zolang ze maar ondersteunen in het destilleren van waarde uit data.
Je neemt bestaande databronnen nauwkeurig onder de loep. Niet alleen schat je de toegevoegde waarde in van onontgonnen bronnen, ook beoordeel je de kwaliteit van de gegevens. En verbeter je waar mogelijk, natuurlijk.
Je ontwikkelt en implementeert data pipelines. Die laten integratie en verrijking van ruwe gegevens toe. En stelt ze ter beschikking voor verdere analyse.
Je werkplek: bij je klant, Geo-kantoor/hub, thuis


Daarom ben jij onze Data Engineer bij uitstek 

Onder andere omdat jij allergisch bent aan manuele stappen in dataverwerking. En omdat je graag het beste van jezelf geeft binnen een transparante en innovatieve cultuur. We kijken dan ook uit naar een Data Engineer die weet van aanpakken:
Je hebt een bachelor- of masterdiploma in computerwetenschappen, engineering, toegepaste wetenschappen of je bent gelijkwaardig door ervaring.
Je bent even communicatief als organisatorisch sterk. Dat maakt je, naast je technische skills natuurlijk, een uitstekende aanvulling op ons team.
Je hebt ervaring met data modellering en het opzetten van robuuste en performante data pipelines.
Je programmeert als geen ander in √©√©n of meerdere courante programmeertalen (Python, Scala, Java, ‚Ä¶) en je hebt kennis van Linux.
SQL kent geen geheimen voor jou, √©n je hebt praktische kennis van een of meerdere databanken (zoals Oracle, SQLServer en PostgreSQL). Als rasechte specialist weet je wanneer noSQL een meerwaarde biedt.
Je hebt kennis van CI/CD en DevOps tools en concepten.
Je hebt ervaring met √©√©n of meerdere cloud platformen.
Kennis of ervaring met ruimtelijke informatie en de specifieke uitdagingen die de verwerking van locatiedata zo typeren zijn een plus.


Dit krijg je van ons 

In ruil voor je precisie en professionaliteit geven we je een boeiende job in een nog boeiender, vooruitstrevend en groeiend bedrijf. En dat in een bedrijfscultuur die verantwoordelijkheidszin en innovatie stimuleert! Geen enkele dag is dezelfde, maar groeien en bijleren doe je altijd.
Bij Geo Solutions mag je rekenen op:
Doorgroeimogelijkheden. Vertel ons je grootste passie en laat je talent zien. Wij zorgen voor jouw carri√®rekansen
Trainingen en opleidingen. Nog beter worden in je vak? Trainingsmogelijkheden zoals ons innovatieforum en de Geo Academy zorgen ervoor.
Een goede work-life balance. Naast aandacht voor je carri√®re houden we rekening met jouw work-life balance. Jouw mentale welzijn primeert.
Veel ambitie en creativiteit. Elke dag opnieuw krijg je de kans om je stempel te drukken op Geo Solutions. Laat je creativiteit dus gerust de vrije loop.
State of the art methodieken. Want hoe geef je anders het beste van jezelf?


En nu over Geo Solutions

Onze IT services richten zich op het design en de ontwikkeling van GEO-ICT oplossingen: op maat gemaakte locatie-intelligente oplossingen gebaseerd op de meest vooruitstrevende technologie√´n zoals AR, AI, ... of het integreren van bestaande systemen met locatie-gebaseerde diensten.

Veel van onze oplossingen en strategie√´n zijn gebaseerd op Geographic Information Systems (GIS) en Information & Communication Technologies (ICT).

What is Amplemarket all about?

Amplemarket's premise is that a lot of the playbooks used by B2B sales teams that worked 5 years ago don't cut it anymore.

In today's environment, sales teams need to have a tremendous amount of information about their prospects to decide when is the best moment and channel to reach out in the most relevant way. You can't do this with 5 different data/sales enablement point solutions that don't share the same data schema and barely communicate with each other. Amplemarket is the all-in-one compound solution that enables this.

Our AI-powered sales platform helps B2B companies generate more opportunities thanks to our advanced lead generation engine, hyper-personalized sequencing, omnichannel outreach, and AI-powered smart actions. We are backed by Y Combinator, and we are powering the sales teams at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world like Deel, Moveworks, H1 and Vanta.

Important Notice: Beware of Recruitment Scams

It has come to our attention that there are fraudulent activities targeting job seekers, where individuals are impersonating Amplemarket by using fake profiles, domains, and emails.

Please be informed that Amplemarket always uses our main domain (amplemarket.com) for all hiring and recruitment purposes. Any communication or offer not originating from an amplemarket.com email address should be regarded as suspicious.

We will never request personal financial information (such as bank account details) during the initial application or interview process.
Our hiring process does not involve transferring money or making payments of any kind to secure a position.

Are you up for a challenge? Amplemarket welcomes spontaneous applications from talented people who are eager to join our team.

We are always on the lookout for exceptional Data Engineers who want to revolutionize the future of sales, while thriving in an incredible Engineering environment.

Do you have experience with writing code to ingest data? Do you like data wrangling, digging into data sources, and processing data to a readable and usable state?

Then this Data Engineer job is just what you are looking for!

We need your expertise

For multiple enterprise customers we create data connectors to make data flow from various sources, using state-of-the art technologies and cloud providers like Azure. But we are agnostic and do not shy away from any technical implementation.

Activities
Create data connectors or processing solutions, using Python or other coding languages.
Define validation tests to run in the data pipeline.
Define monitoring and alerting to ensure visibility when the data flow is interrupted or corrupted.
If incidents occur, you take the lead in getting to the root cause as soon as possible to solve the incident with as little impact on the end users as possible.
Interact and validate with end users for the solutions you build, aiming for continuous improvement.
You and the team are responsible for building, deploying, maintaining, and optimizing the data flow solution.

This is what we offer

You will be given the opportunity to develop in the best way possible, under the personal guidance of fellow data engineers and architects of Itility. We have several trainings available in our own Itility Academy to help you develop your hard & soft skills. But also an active community that organizes tech hours to share knowledge, demo solutions and new tools.
In addition to a competitive salary, you will receive extras such as:

26 vacation days
115 euros cost allowance
Lease car or mobility allowance
50% health insurance contribution
60% retirement plan contribution
Performance based bonus
Laptop and phone
Itility Academy - hard & soft skills training
Hybrid working

This is you

You are familiar with the scrum/agile way-of-working and in software practices that enable a professional data flow. Further requirements:
You have a bachelor‚Äôs or master‚Äôs degree.
You have experience creating data ingestion scripts.
Experience with Azure is a pre.
You have 2 ‚Äì 3 years of relevant work experience.
You have a good understanding of SQL and Python.
You are a team player and you have good communication skills.
Ideally, you have worked with data platforms and data lakes within an enterprise environment.

Welcome to Blue Radix
Blue Radix is the AI-specialist and market leader on autonomous greenhouse management in the international horticulture market. Our customers grow high-quality crops with good profits with the latest technology.

Artefact, ein globales KI- und Datenberatungsunternehmen mit rasantem Wachstum, sucht eine:n kommunikative:n, innovative:n Data Engineer (m/w/d) f√ºr das Tech-Team in Vollzeit. Wirst du das sein?

Unser Data Engineering Team verwandelt ein breites Spektrum an technischer Expertise in L√∂sungen, die jahrelang genutzt werden k√∂nnen und f√ºr unsere Kunden echten Mehrwert bringen. Du wirst Erfahrungen im Umgang mit Kunden und nichttechnischen Personen sammeln und die Auswirkung deiner Arbeit in der Praxis sehen.

Welche Aufgaben du bei uns √ºbernimmst:

Du hilfst dabei, Datenpipelines einzurichten, zu implementieren und zu pflegen. Die meisten unserer Aufgaben drehen sich um Datenpipelines, obwohl wir in verschiedenen Stadien des Lebenszyklus eingreifen k√∂nnen, von der Erstellung einer Datenplattform von Grund auf, √ºber die Umstellung auf neue Datenarchitekturen bis hin zur √úberpr√ºfung der Sicherheit einer bestehenden Einrichtung usw.
Du wirst ein breites Spektrum an Erfahrungen im Bereich Data Engineering sammeln. Es wird von dir erwartet, dass du an einigen Missionen pro Jahr (1-3) mitarbeitest, bei denen du verschiedene Branchen, Anwendungsf√§lle und Technologien kennen lernst. Selbst innerhalb einer Mission k√∂nnen deine t√§glichen Aufgaben sehr unterschiedlich sein!
Du wirst sehen, welche Auswirkungen deine Arbeit in der realen Welt hat. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Unternehmen, die sich auf Vapor Ware spezialisiert haben, bauen wir L√∂sungen, die jahrelang genutzt werden k√∂nnen und f√ºr unsere Kunden tats√§chlich etwas bewirken. Das bedeutet auch, dass du Erfahrungen im Umgang mit Kunden und nicht-technischen Menschen sammeln wirst.
Du wirst mit hochmodernen Tools arbeiten. Unser Stack variiert von Kunde zu Kunde, ist aber im Allgemeinen recht modern - GCP mit Terraform, DBT und Vertex AI, um nur ein aktuelles Beispiel zu nennen. In der Regel verwenden wir jedoch Python als Programmiersprache.

Was du mitbringst:

Du beherrschst eine Programmiersprache (vorzugsweise Python, aber es kann auch C++, Java usw. sein). Wenn diese Sprache nicht Python ist, m√ºssen wir sicher sein, dass du sie leicht erlernen kannst.
Neben deinen Programmierkenntnissen verf√ºgst du √ºber eine echte Datenkultur: Du kennst dich mit ETL-Workflows und Datenbankkonzepten aus
Du verf√ºgst √ºber sehr gute SQL-Kenntnisse und bist in der Lage, leistungsstarke und effiziente Abfragen zu schreiben.
Du hast ausgezeichnete Probleml√∂sungsf√§higkeiten und lernst schnell.
Du kannst in einem Team von Programmierern arbeiten: Du wei√üt, wie man Git benutzt, du kannst Unit- und Integrationstests schreiben, du kannst deinen Kollegen deine Arbeit klar erkl√§ren, du wei√üt, wie man nach externen Ressourcen sucht und um Hilfe bittet, usw.

‚ÄúNice-to-haves‚Äù
Wir erwarten nicht, dass du alle diese Anforderungen erf√ºllst, aber du solltest zumindest ein paar davon mitbringen:

Du hast neben deinen Software-Engineering-F√§higkeiten auch einen Data-Science-Hintergrund und bist in der Lage, eine Art Hybridprofil zwischen Data Scientist und Data Engineer zu sein.
Du hast Erfahrung in der Arbeit an Produktionssystemen oder mit Kundendaten.
Du hast bereits in Agile/Scrum-Umgebungen gearbeitet und kennst dich mit Tools wie Jira aus.
Du hast bereits Erfahrung mit dem Aufbau von Datenpipelines f√ºr ML/AI-Projekte und nutzt Technologien wie Airflow, Spark, LangChain usw.
Du kennst dich gut mit Datenbanksystemen aus und wei√üt, wie man sie am besten f√ºr bestimmte Datenverwendungszwecke einrichtet.
Du bist ein angehender MLOps-Experte und wei√üt, wie man Machine-Learning-Modelle in der Produktion verwaltet und √ºberwacht.
Du hast umfangreiche Erfahrung mit Cloud-Umgebungen (AWS, Azure, GCP). Bonuspunkte gibt es, wenn du mit den Data-Engineering-Komponenten dieser Cloud-Umgebungen gearbeitet hast (Dataflow / Vertex AI / Dataproc, Sagemaker, HDInsight, Databricks, etc.)
Du kennst dich mit Netzwerken und Sicherheitskonzepten aus.

In partnership with the Multichoice Group and SuperSport, SuperSportBet enhances the passion that sports fans have for the game with a world-class sports betting and casino experience.

As our Kingdom expands, we proudly stand as the leading Sports and Digital Entertainment platform in Africa, and we are still actively hiring an exceptional team of Creators and Innovators across Africa, the United Kingdom, Europe, and the Middle East.

There has never been a better time to join our Kingdom than today!

What You Will Be Doing: 

Design it: building and managing a highly robust and scalable Data Lake/ETL infrastructure and a scalable data pipeline that is capable of streaming and batch processing modes 
Run it: ensure we build fault-tolerant systems and processes, where data integrity is king and underpinned by automated data quality monitoring and alerting
Evolve it: constantly look for things to improve, whether fixing recurring problems, delivering small but helpful features or optimizing for performance and scalability

Openness, Honesty & Directness: We embrace a culture of candor and work together towards the right solution whilst being open, honest, and willing to give and receive feedback, judgment-free. We play the ball, not the person. 
Innovation & Big Thinking: We always look for ways to innovate whilst not losing sight of what's important. The bigger we think, the more we inspire, the better the outcome. 
Ownership & Accountability: We think like owners. If we see a problem, we find a solution. We are pragmatic and always strive to do more with less. 
Speed & Focus: We plan, we strategize, but mostly, we DO. Without doing, there is no progress, we can always change direction but only if we start moving. Fast beats slow. 
Low Ego: The best solutions are achieved when we leave our egos at the door. We always seek opportunities to learn in every situation. No job too small. 
Fun: On balance, we believe in having fun whilst working. We maintain perspective as best as we can, and together, we celebrate our successes.

Beyond our great company benefits and competitive salaries, we recognize that to grow sustainably and thrive positively we need to engage the right talent because our people are a merit to our success.

It‚Äôs this passion that guarantees we‚Äôll create real value and impact. And then we‚Äôll be driven to do it all over again.

üí™‚Ää Ce qui fait notre force ?

üîπ Achieve greatness - Notre culture est digital native. 

L‚Äôagilit√© est au c≈ìur de notre fonctionnement. On s‚Äôest inspir√©s des pratiques des entreprises Digital Natives pour construire notre succ√®s : agilit√©, rapidit√© dans les prises de d√©cision, organisation d√©centralis√©e, promotion et utilisation de l‚ÄôOpen Source, etc.

üîπ Proud to be developers - Notre strat√©gie est co-construite, par les Techs pour les Techs.

La direction g√©n√©rale et la direction de chaque agence sont co-lead√©es par 2 Managing Directors : Business & Engineering

Individuellement, chaque d√©veloppeur et d√©veloppeuse reporte √† un Engineering Manager. Ce dernier est lui-m√™me d√©veloppeur et a du temps d√©di√© pour manager. Il travaille √©troitement avec le Business pour proposer les missions les plus adapt√©es √† chacun.

üîπ Learn & Share - Notre communaut√© est apprenante et dans le partage.

Nous sommes partenaires officiels de Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft, Confluent, MongoDB, Linux Foundation, GitLab, SaFe, Snowflake, Looker, entre autres.

Nous sommes pr√©sents √† de nombreux √©v√®nements Techs au niveau national et r√©gional : tu as s√ªrement crois√© des Sfeiriennes et Sfeiriens si tu vas aux Meetups, aux DevFest ou aux Hackathons (Health et Industry Camp).

üë©‚Äçüíª‚Ääüë®‚Äçüíª Qui sont les Sfeiriennes et les Sfeiriens ? 

100% des d√©veloppeur.euse.s sont des techs passionn√©.e.s par leur m√©tier.

Ce qui nous rassemble aussi, c‚Äôest notre envie de contribuer √† la communaut√© et √† l‚Äôentreprise.

On a une hi√©rarchie tr√®s plate : on croit que l‚Äôentreprise est plus performante quand elle favorise l‚Äôautonomie et l‚Äôintelligence collective.

Tu t‚Äôattendais √† ce qu‚Äôon te parle d‚Äô√©tudes, de dipl√¥mes ou d‚Äôexp√©rience, dans cette section‚ÄØ? Chez SFEIR, on n‚Äôa qu‚Äôun seul crit√®re : c‚Äôest ton niveau technique et ta culture tech. On en reparle un peu plus bas !

On travaille avec une trentaine de clients. Ce sont des grandes entreprises du monde de la banque, assurance, industrie ou des startups/scaleups.

En mission pour l‚Äôun d‚Äôentre eux ou sur notre Factory, sur des stacks r√©centes, tu con√ßois et d√©veloppes des solutions pour r√©pondre aux enjeux data.

Au-del√† de ta ma√Ætrise de Python ou Scala et de l'√©cosyst√®me Data (ex : Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, ‚Ä¶) tu es quelqu'un de curieux(se) et dans le partage !

@Audrey , @Cl√©ment , @Samar & @Siham , nos super Account Managers, seront √† ton √©coute pour d√©finir avec toi le projet id√©al et tu pourras en changer lorsque tu en auras fait le tour.

üöÄ Et si je souhaite √©voluer ? 

On se doute que tu veux te d√©velopper. Et on a r√©fl√©chi √† ce qui pourrait te plaire.

Une fois que tu as fait le tour de ton poste, voil√† diff√©rents r√¥les que tu pourrais prendre chez SFEIR (mais ce n'est pas une obligation) :

üîπ Si tu veux rester 100% Tech : les Staff Engineer sont des r√©f√©rents techniques dans leur domaine et consacrent entre 1 et 4 jours par semaine √† la communaut√©, en diffusant du savoir technique : formations, conseil aux managers, r√©ponse aux appels d‚Äôoffres avec l‚Äô√©quipe commerciale, ‚Ä¶

üîπ Si tu veux t‚Äôorienter vers du Management : Les Engineering Managers sont les r√©f√©rents des D√©veloppeurs en mission. Tu serais leur coach pour les aider √† se sentir bien dans leur job, les faire grandir et suivre leur carri√®re.

Tu auras √©galement la possibilit√© de prendre des casquettes suppl√©mentaires en interne si tu le souhaites :

üîπ Tech Recruiter dans le processus de recrutement ;

üîπ Trainer aux SFEIR Schools ou au SFEIR Institute ;

üîπ Speaker lors de conf√©rences, meetups, talks, aupr√®s des √©coles, ‚Ä¶

Et si tu as d'autres envies, on en discute. Chacun est diff√©rent et on fait au cas par cas.

üí∞ Combien tu vas gagner chez SFEIR ?

Chez nous, pas de grille de salaire fig√©e dans le marbre ! Cependant, il est important pour nous de garder une homog√©n√©it√© entre les salari√©(e)s en se basant sur les comp√©tences et le march√© actuel.

On pourra t‚Äôen dire plus d√®s que tu auras pass√© notre process de recrutement technique, les PlayOffs, car les salaires que nous proposons ne prennent pas en compte ton √¢ge, tes dipl√¥mes ou ton background. Tes comp√©tences, rien que tes comp√©tences !

En revanche, on peut te dire que, peu importe le salaire, un ‚ÄúComit√© Carri√®re‚Äù annuel suit ton √©volution et te permet de revoir ta r√©mun√©ration chaque ann√©e.

Tu b√©n√©ficieras √©galement des avantages suivants :

üíª‚Ää Pr√©sentiel ou t√©l√©travail ?

Les deux, mon capitaine !

On s‚Äôadapte √† nos clients, mais la plupart sont en hybride. On se doit simplement de respecter la limite l√©gale pour les frontaliers.

üëã‚Ää ‚ÄúJe suis int√©ress√©(e), comment vous rejoindre ?‚Äù

Si cette annonce a attir√© ton attention, il ne te reste plus qu'√† postuler !

Ils te donneront aussi un aper√ßu de la culture d‚Äôentreprise et de la vie chez nous ! Tu pourras aussi discuter avec un commercial qui te pr√©sentera nos clients et projets, si tu le souhaites.

Max 2 jours apr√®s les PlayOffs, on revient vers toi pour te d√©briefer, et :

At Gerulata Technologies, we are a young tech firm located in Bratislava, developing sophisticated analytical applications utilizing cutting-edge technologies and the latest advances in AI.

Our products support high-level decision-making within government institutions, including defense and intelligence sectors. We're a passionate small team, dedicated to supporting democratic institutions and combating disinformation and hostile propaganda.

We work together with different NGOs and research institutions to deliver high-value products on a global scale. Our clients include government institutions, military organizations, law enforcement agencies, and the intelligence community.

Scalability is another challenge you will tackle. You'll move from manually monitoring a handful of groups to building an automated system that scales dynamically as new data sources are discovered. Our aim isn't just incremental growth; we seek a fundamental transformation in the scale of our operations.

Currently, our coverage extends to Slovakia and a few neighboring states, but our ambition is to expand across all of Europe, America, and eventually achieve global coverage. Our products must be multi-lingual, multi-modal, and cross-border to achieve this goal.

Docker + Kubernetes
Gitlab CI/CD
RabbitMQ
Redis
ElasticSearch
PostgreSQL
OpenCypher (graph query language)
