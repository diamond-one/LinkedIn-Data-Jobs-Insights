Robovision is a rapidly growing scale-up that develops innovative software solutions to enable the creation of intelligent technological solutions. Our current key focus areas are Agriculture, Manufacturing, Retail and Healthcare.
We are combining knowledge and expertise in camera technology, computer vision practices, data science and software engineering to design and build state of the art software solutions that are able to efficiently and effectively solve business problems that could not be solved with traditional technologies.


Reasons for the role
For several state of the art projects we depend on stereo vision to obtain a 3D image. Our current stereo algorithm relies on classical computer vision. Recently, major innovations have taken place in the field of deep learning-based stereo vision. We attempt to leverage these innovations and aim to replace the classical computer vision algorithm with a deep learning alternative.


What will you do?
Among the various deep learning stereo algorithms, some excel in accuracy but are slow, while others are fast but less accurate. Our projects demand a model that is both fast and accurate. This internship aims to merge these two types of algorithms using model distillation (student-teacher learning) to develop an efficient and precise model. The goal extends beyond creating a proof of concept: we seek to establish an easy-to-use framework for rapidly retraining models on project-specific data derived from the teacher model. We have a validation method in place to verify accuracy, allowing you to easily validate your work and benchmark it against our current solution.


Who are you?
A (master's) student with hands-on machine learning experience. You are passionate about deep learning and eager to tackle challenging problems. You have a solid foundation in Python programming and are comfortable working with scientific computing tools. You have a keen interest in developing and optimizing machine learning models.

Strong understanding of neural networks and deep learning concepts, specifically in the area of computer vision
Experience with model validation and evaluation methods
Familiarity with data preprocessing and augmentation techniques
Ability to implement and optimise machine learning models
Familiarity with version control systems like Git

Optional skills:
Knowledge of model distillation and student-teacher learning techniques
Experience with stereo vision (depth) algorithms


What do we offer?
A dynamic high tech environment where initiative and strong hands-on mentality are valued

Chez Lifen 🩺 nous nous engageons auprès des professionnels de santé pour relever ce défi grâce à une expertise en intelligence artificielle couplée à l'obsession de l'impact terrain. Depuis 2015, nous développons, pas à pas, une infrastructure permettant aux professionnels de santé de s'appuyer sur les bonnes données au bon moment pour chaque patient.

Aujourd'hui, plus de 800 hôpitaux et 20 000 professionnels de santé libéraux utilisent nos solutions pour réduire la charge administrative, personnaliser le soin et accélérer la recherche clinique. À leurs côtés, nous sommes de 160 Lifeners passionnés 👩‍🚀🧑‍💻 qui nous engageons à innover sans relâche pour construire un monde en meilleure santé.

Rejoins-nous !

L'équipe Machine Learning

Fournissant quotidiennement plus d'un million de prédictions en temps réel à notre base d'utilisateurs, l'équipe IA a joué un rôle déterminant dans le lancement de notre produit phare, Lifen Document, qui facilite l'échange de comptes rendus médicaux entre praticiens de santé en France. Au cours des 6 dernières années passées à traiter des données médicales, notre équipe a acquis une solide expertise dans la construction de modèles robustes qui apportent une valeur ajoutée à nos utilisateurs en accélérant les charges de travail administratives laborieuses et intensives, avec des normes élevées en termes de sécurité.

Notre équipe actuelle (2 ML Engineers et 1 Lead ML Engineer) construit des modèles de pré-traitement des documents, notamment d'extraction de layout, des outils internes d'explainable AI et de labélisation, des algorithmes de pseudonymisation pour pouvoir travailler sur des algorithmes sans exposer des données médicales privées, et enfin des algorithmes de NLP pour structurer les documents médicaux (Classification, NER, ...).

Nous utilisons aussi des LLMs en production pour certaines taches d'extraction de données médicales. Nous travaillons sur une pipeline de fine-tuning de LLMs Open Source.

Lifen investit aujourd'hui dans une nouvelle offre destinée aux organismes de santé et aux partenaires de recherches universitaires et industriels, qui s'appuiera sur notre expertise dans le traitement des documents médicaux, pour structurer des données de qualité dans le monde réel, à partir des rapports médicaux traités par Lifen : Lifen Data Lab.

Il nostro machine learning engineer ideale dovrà essere capace di elaborare soluzioni creative a problemi concreti, lavorando su basi di dati strutturate e non strutturate per sintetizzare nuove feature per lo sviluppo dei modelli. Sfruttando al meglio le risorse e le tecnologie cloud disponibili, ti occuperai di “trainare”, testare e mettere in produzione algoritmi di machine learning ad altre prestazioni.

🥵 Quale problema risolviamo?
Ti capita mai di trovare scaffali vuoti al supermercato proprio quando volevi uno specifico prodotto? Ecco questo crea ogni anno una perdita di fatturato del 5% per le aziende della distribuzione alimentare. La causa di questo fenomeno? La difficoltà di prevedere i fabbisogni di vendita.

💡 La soluzione?
In Tuidi sviluppiamo degli assistenti virtuali che si basano su tecnologie innovative di Intelligenza Artificiale e Machine Learning per prevedere la domanda di prodotti.
Studiamo come variabili interne ed esterne impattano le decisioni dei consumatori così da suggerire alle aziende come evitare sprechi alimentari e perdite del fatturato.

3. Semplicità di comunicazione: la tecnologia deve essere fruibile e comprensibile per tutti (un’IA for Dummies se vogliamo) 
4. Idee: vogliamo persone che vogliono portare sul tavolo continuamente qualcosa di nuovo, in fondo da dove arriva l’innovazione? 
5. Lavoro di squadra: vogliamo creare un ambiente che sia più di un semplice luogo di lavoro, è per questo che la sera ci ritroviamo tutti sul canale discord per fare karaoke! 
6. Fiducia: Costruiamo con i nostri dipendenti un solido ed efficace rapporto di fiducia e delega, così da fare entrare loro più in sintonia con tutto il team ed avere un rapporto più sicuro con clienti.

Just as every tooth is unique and requires precision in its care, our AI solutions demand precision in their design and implementation. At Promaton, we're revolutionizing dental healthcare with AI, and we need your expertise. See our company page to learn more about what we do.

As a Software Engineer in Machine Learning you will be working closely with our platform and product teams, enabling fast iterations and scalable ML solutions for existing and future products. You will extend our already successful track record of 5 ML products processing thousands of cases weekly for over 1K customers.

As part of our dynamic team, you will be:

Improving and contributing to the design and architecture of a complex set of interdependent ML pipelines.
Following MLOps best practices by maintaining and extending our CI/CD pipelines, dashboards, dev/test/prod environments, autoscaling, etc.
Working with an accomplished team of machine learning researchers and engineers that already have 8 patents on their name.
Helping researchers launch new products and help maintain the ones already used by customers.


Some initiatives on our MLOps roadmap for the next months:

 Improving speed and robustness of multiple machine learning products
 Continuous monitoring of incoming data in production


The challenges you’ll face:

All our products process large data points, ranging from 5 up to 700MB. This means that a lot of off-the-shelf tooling doesn't work for us, and we need to invent our own to process and manage our data.
Our teams are growing and so is our code base. This comes with the challenge to keep it well-designed and maintainable.
We are a cloud-native company, and cloud-native ML frameworks are still in their early days. You'll help us navigate the ever-evolving ecosystem of tools, to make sure we find the right balance between off-the-shelf and home-grown tooling.
Medical AI has to comply with the highest quality standards. While in other industries failing to predict for example a recommended product has little consequence, in the medical field you don't want to be wrong.


The perks of working at Promaton:

💰 Attractive salary package, and excellent employment terms

🏡 Excellent work/life balance. Freedom to work from home or anywhere you like (and any time you like). We only have a few touchpoints.

👩‍🔬 Dedicated time for hackathons and growth, to explore new ideas of your own. Every quarter we have a hackathon week where you can work on anything you like to expand your skill set!

🙌 Staying up to date with the latest happenings in the ML field can be hard. That is why we organize monthly paper review sessions to discuss the latest developments in the field to stay up to date with the current state-of-the-art. Next to that we regularly hold “ML Sparring Sessions” where you can spar with other MLRs in the company on potential directions for projects you are working on.

🎓 Real training budget for books and conferences or anything else you need to grow

🚀 Work with the latest technology, at the forefront of a rapidly developing field in medical imaging AI. Checkout our techstack here.

💪 Loads of responsibility and autonomy (we hate micromanagement) and a chance to make a real impact

🏖 Awesome yearly company retreat, and quarterly team events

⛺️ 32 days of annual leave (25 days + 7 national holidays)

💻 Top-notch gear, and even bigger servers to play with

🏄‍♂️ Promaton is funded for many years to come, meaning you can have the impact you only get at a startup, but with the job security of an established company

🛬 For international engineers, based in the NL (already relocated to the Netherlands) we are able to offer visa sponsorship

🎈Inclusive environment, we value and celebrate diversity

4+ years experience working with Python and Pytorch
Solid understanding of software development best practices
A passion for software and ML pipeline design concepts
The git ecosystem is your natural habitat
Know how good tests improve developer velocity
Experience with continuous deployment of live products
Experience with AWS/GCP/Azure or Kubernetes deployment
Good collaboration and communication skills


Bonus points:

Experience with experiment, model and data tracking
Knowledge of machine learning fundamentals
Worked with 3D data, like meshes and point clouds
Experience working asynchronously with a distributed team
Previous experience in medical or other regulated field


We're excited to see how you can make a difference in our team. If you're passionate about making a tangible impact in healthcare through AI, we'd love to hear from you!

Good to know:

It goes without saying that we love the power of AI, but we believe the human touch is irreplaceable in recruitment. We are looking forward to your personalized answers to our screening questions, not ChatGPT's insights!
Wondering if you should you apply if your experience doesn't fit all of the job requirements? In general, we are aiming for an 80% match, so please go ahead if you got excited by the role and by the idea of joining our team! Not the right role? You can still send us an open application!

Are you a full-stack AI wizard ready to redefine the frontier of K-12 learning? Join the education revolution at 2 Hour Learning!

At 2 Hour Learning, we're not just talking about transforming education - we're proving it with hard data. Our learning ecosystem harnesses cutting-edge AI, learning science, and psychometrics to create a digital learning environment that's twice as effective as traditional schooling. High schoolers ace AP exams, middle schoolers advance 2 grade levels per year, and even kindergarteners shatter learning goals.

You'll play a pivotal role in architecting this AI-powered learning revolution. You'll wield autonomy and creative freedom to envision, code, and ship sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that engage students and drive learning efficiency to unprecedented heights.

This isn't a role for AI dabblers or back-end-only coders. We seek bold AI architects who can seamlessly weave AI magic across front-end interfaces, back-end algorithms, and end-to-end product experiences. You'll own and optimize the entire product lifecycle, partnering closely with stakeholders to ensure we're nailing learner needs.

If you're energized by leveraging generative AI breakthroughs to tangibly level up learning for thousands of students and unafraid to challenge educational norms in the process, this is your frontier.

Wasting hours on manual QA; you'll leverage AI-powered testing to maximize efficiency

Artificial Intelligence Engineer Key Responsibilities

Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Basic Requirements

3+ years full stack development experience with frameworks like React, Angular, Node.js, Django, etc.

Hands-on experience with large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, or Claude, integrating these AI solutions into web applications
Outstanding communication skills to champion ideas and interact with users
Passion for pushing the boundaries of generative AI to revolutionize how the world learns

Job Overview

We are currently seeking Developers for project-specific roles focused on RLHF. This role will play a key part in our reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) initiatives, contributing to cutting-edge projects.

You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for for the worlds most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the biggest players in the AI/LLM space today. We are seeking software engineers with 4+ years of experience to train AI large language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!

What Will I Be Doing?

Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from """"which piece of Python code is better?"""" to """"make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""""

Contract Length

This project is expected to last until the end of September and you'll be able to continue to work on other projects (though likely not in Swift). 
You can end the contract at any time. 

Flexible Schedules

Developers can set their own hours - ideal candidates will be interested in spending 15+ hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but incredibly flexible on working hours. 
Take a 3 hour lunch, no problem. You are paid according to time spent on the platform, which is calculated in the coding exercises, as opposed to tracking your own hours. 

Compensation

US: $50 /hr
Brazil: $28.70/hr
Egypt: $22.05/hr
Phillipines: $25.55/hr
All other countries: $35/hr

Interview Process

We've created a 3.5 hour screening and onboarding process to join as a Software Engineer for AI Training Data which can be accomplished in 1 week or less. We purposely perform most of these steps asynchronously because most of the RLHF work is async and self guided. After you apply, if you look like a good fit we'll provide you access to the G2i dashboard to go through this simple screening process.

Step 1: Learn in depth about the role (35 min)

Step 2: Perform a simple RLHF code review (35 min)

While MLEs in the success team focus on the delivery of the services working hand in hand with the customer data scientists and machine learning engineers, the Senior Post-Sales ML Engineer will engage with the customer leads and managers to maintain awareness of the value and discuss business problems Hugging Face can help solve or accelerate.
In order to be effective in this role, the Senior Post-Sales ML Engineer needs to be credible and relevant when discussing the applications of transformers and diffusers models to the customer business, understand the work being done by MLEs and translate it into value for the customer business, representing accurately the business opportunities corresponding to the latest models and innovations shipped by the Hugging Face teams - without the need for a """"technical"""" person to break it down for them.
What you are expected to do:
Empathize with our customers to understand their issues and goals when using transformers (NLP and Vision primarily)
Have the scrappiness and be excited to solve customer problems through research, coding up a solution, or talking to our many in-house experts
Build meaningful relationships with our customers and understand their goals
Comfortably explain complex concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences
Constantly be learning and sharing your knowledge with our customers
What we are looking for:
Experience building NLP/Vision solutions. We need people to hit the ground running and this position is not intended to train someone in the fundamentals of ML. You should understand the ML Lifecycle and basics of cloud infrastructure
Experience with the transformers library. Our customers come to us for our experience with transformers. We expect you to already have good proficiency with transformers and you will quickly become an expert
Self-starter: We need people that can tackle hard problems independently. While there are plenty of gracious smart people that are eager to collaborate within Hugging Face, we are looking for people who are scrappy, self-motivated, and resourceful
Attention to detail: Will you write a meaningful paragraph for why you want to work at Hugging Face that touches upon what we are looking for?
Customer relationship builder: We want people who are excited to build relationships with customers and help them succeed. This isn't a role for a heads-down coder. You will be collaborating and providing value to our customer's ML teams
Great communicator: Can you explain how you solved a problem to someone that isn't technical? This role involves talking to a variety of roles from C-level executives, to domain experts, and IT professionals
Coding: You should be comfortable writing code scripts and notebooks on transformers/ML Ops use cases that will be reused by the customers
Learn quickly: The field and company are both moving very fast: new breakthroughs in the AI/ML space come out practically every week, and Hugging Face is constantly adding new packages to the open-source community, contributing to open-science, and building more enterprise products. We want someone that enjoys learning about state-of-the-art developments and sharing them with customers
If you're interested in joining us, but don't tick every box above, we still encourage you to apply! We're building a diverse team whose skills, experiences, and backgrounds complement one another. We're happy to consider where you might be able to make the biggest impact
What you will get:
Be part of one of the hottest startups in AI
Work with a diverse outstanding set of team members that are experts in academia, open source, and working with enterprises
Become an expert on transformers. You will understand transformers within the ML lifecycle from pretrain to deployment. Furthermore, you will see how transformers are used across many industries and stages of development
Work within an organization that focuses on impact rather than a top-down structure around specific duties. We want people to have a huge impact inside the company and support you in working in a manner that works best for you. Flexibility to work in a way that best suits you
An environment that encourages and cultivates learning, sharing, using your individual expertise, and constructive feedback
More about Hugging Face
We are actively working to build a culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusivity. We are intentionally building a workplace where people feel respected and supported—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We believe this is foundational to building a great company and community. Hugging Face is an equal opportunity employer and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Modulai works with fish, trains, clothes, money, pets, office spaces, sound sensors and much more. If there is data, we do ML (Machine Learning) on it.

Our team consists of devoted ML engineers with strong track records from some of Sweden’s most successful startups. We work on project basis and take end-to-end responsibility. We love ML and we think that the best way for us to expand our knowledge is to be exposed to a diversified set of challenging and fun projects.

MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER

As a member of the ML-team you will be working with a broad range of problems with one common denominator – ML will be the key ingredient. The projects could be external as well as internal – and in all cases – delivery is central.

You will have to analyze the problem at hand, come up with a solution strategy and execute on it. This typically entails gaining an in-depth understanding of the challenge, understanding the available data and then re-formulating it as a ML problem. It requires openness, creativity and an eagerness to learn new methodology and exploring new terrains.

We frequently attack these problems as a team, meaning that you will have to be able to clearly explain your reasoning and code in order to engage the rest of us.

Our Stack 

Python / R – standard open source libraries Scikit-learn and various specialized Python and R ML libraries Deep learning frameworks such as Pytorch and Tensorflow/Keras Cloud platforms such as GCP and AWS Relational database management systems Distributed processing such as Apache Spark

Responsibilites

Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from """"which piece of Python code is better?"""" to """"make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""""

Robovision is a rapidly growing scale-up that develops innovative software solutions to enable the creation of intelligent technological solutions. Our current key focus areas are Agriculture, Manufacturing, Retail and Healthcare.
We are combining knowledge and expertise in camera technology, computer vision practices, data science and software engineering to design and build state of the art software solutions that are able to efficiently and effectively solve business problems that could not be solved with traditional technologies.


Reasons for the role
For several state of the art projects we depend on stereo vision to obtain a 3D image. Our current stereo algorithm relies on classical computer vision. Recently, major innovations have taken place in the field of deep learning-based stereo vision. We attempt to leverage these innovations and aim to replace the classical computer vision algorithm with a deep learning alternative.


What will you do?
Among the various deep learning stereo algorithms, some excel in accuracy but are slow, while others are fast but less accurate. Our projects demand a model that is both fast and accurate. This internship aims to merge these two types of algorithms using model distillation (student-teacher learning) to develop an efficient and precise model. The goal extends beyond creating a proof of concept: we seek to establish an easy-to-use framework for rapidly retraining models on project-specific data derived from the teacher model. We have a validation method in place to verify accuracy, allowing you to easily validate your work and benchmark it against our current solution.


Who are you?
A (master's) student with hands-on machine learning experience. You are passionate about deep learning and eager to tackle challenging problems. You have a solid foundation in Python programming and are comfortable working with scientific computing tools. You have a keen interest in developing and optimizing machine learning models.

4. Idee: vogliamo persone che vogliono portare sul tavolo continuamente qualcosa di nuovo, in fondo da dove arriva l’innovazione? 
5. Lavoro di squadra: vogliamo creare un ambiente che sia più di un semplice luogo di lavoro, è per questo che la sera ci ritroviamo tutti sul canale discord per fare karaoke!

We have built the fastest-growing, open-source, library of pre-trained models in the world. With more than 1 Million+ models and 320K+ stars on GitHub, over 15.000 companies are using HF technology in production, including leading AI organizations such as Google, Elastic, Salesforce, Grammarly and NASA.
About the Role

As a Machine Learning Advocate Engineer for Computer Vision, you will have a key role in driving the adoption of the Hub platform and Open Source technologies by creating, fostering, and growing communities, extending the use cases of the Hub, developing tools to improve the developer experience, and bringing feedback to the team. You'll collaborate closely with the Open Source, Science, and Product teams.
This is not a marketing position! Developer Advocacy at Hugging Face is deeply technical and having a generalist mindset is essential. Our team contributes to libraries such as Transformers, Diffusers or Datasets, as well as to external libraries. Being able to collaborate technically with the rest of the team is essential.
You'll get to foster and drive collaborations with groups in the ML for Computer Vision Space, lead communications, adopt the latest CV-related features, and build tools for the community.
Some example activities you can work on are:
Build integrations with open-source libraries in the CV space to support collaborations through the Hub platform
Craft and distribute high-quality content such as demos and blog posts
Co-organize events in which state-of-the-art CV models are created
About you

You'll love working here if you enjoy developing your Machine Learning skills and amplifying your impact by engaging with the ecosystem. If you can spend Monday coding, Tuesday designing a workshop, Wednesday writing a blog post, and Thursday crafting ML memes, this job opening is for you! Having good engineering skills combined with solid communication ones is highly desired.
We are growing a team with diverse backgrounds and skills, and hence being proficient in other human languages and having deep connections with your local ecosystem is a substantial bonus. Having experience in Open Source development is a huge bonus. Existing engagement in different platforms (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, etc) is also a bonus but not required.
If you're interested in joining us, but don't tick every box above, we still encourage you to apply! We're building a diverse team whose skills, experiences, and backgrounds complement one another. We're happy to consider where you might be able to make the biggest impact.
More about Hugging Face

We are actively working to build a culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusivity.

About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics.

The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine."""

Just as every tooth is unique and requires precision in its care, our AI solutions demand precision in their design and implementation. At Promaton, we're revolutionizing dental healthcare with AI, and we need your expertise. See our company page to learn more about what we do.

As a Software Engineer in Machine Learning you will be working closely with our platform and product teams, enabling fast iterations and scalable ML solutions for existing and future products. You will extend our already successful track record of 5 ML products processing thousands of cases weekly for over 1K customers.

Working with an accomplished team of machine learning researchers and engineers that already have 8 patents on their name.
Helping researchers launch new products and help maintain the ones already used by customers.


Some initiatives on our MLOps roadmap for the next months:

 Improving speed and robustness of multiple machine learning products
 Continuous monitoring of incoming data in production


The challenges you’ll face:

All our products process large data points, ranging from 5 up to 700MB. This means that a lot of off-the-shelf tooling doesn't work for us, and we need to invent our own to process and manage our data.
Our teams are growing and so is our code base. This comes with the challenge to keep it well-designed and maintainable.
We are a cloud-native company, and cloud-native ML frameworks are still in their early days. You'll help us navigate the ever-evolving ecosystem of tools, to make sure we find the right balance between off-the-shelf and home-grown tooling.
Medical AI has to comply with the highest quality standards. While in other industries failing to predict for example a recommended product has little consequence, in the medical field you don't want to be wrong.


The perks of working at Promaton:

💰 Attractive salary package, and excellent employment terms

🏡 Excellent work/life balance. Freedom to work from home or anywhere you like (and any time you like). We only have a few touchpoints.

👩‍🔬 Dedicated time for hackathons and growth, to explore new ideas of your own. Every quarter we have a hackathon week where you can work on anything you like to expand your skill set!

🙌 Staying up to date with the latest happenings in the ML field can be hard. That is why we organize monthly paper review sessions to discuss the latest developments in the field to stay up to date with the current state-of-the-art. Next to that we regularly hold “ML Sparring Sessions” where you can spar with other MLRs in the company on potential directions for projects you are working on.

🎓 Real training budget for books and conferences or anything else you need to grow

🚀 Work with the latest technology, at the forefront of a rapidly developing field in medical imaging AI. Checkout our techstack here.

💪 Loads of responsibility and autonomy (we hate micromanagement) and a chance to make a real impact

🏖 Awesome yearly company retreat, and quarterly team events

⛺️ 32 days of annual leave (25 days + 7 national holidays)

💻 Top-notch gear, and even bigger servers to play with

🏄‍♂️ Promaton is funded for many years to come, meaning you can have the impact you only get at a startup, but with the job security of an established company

🛬 For international engineers, based in the NL (already relocated to the Netherlands) we are able to offer visa sponsorship

🎈Inclusive environment, we value and celebrate diversity

4+ years experience working with Python and Pytorch
Solid understanding of software development best practices
A passion for software and ML pipeline design concepts
The git ecosystem is your natural habitat
Know how good tests improve developer velocity
Experience with continuous deployment of live products
Experience with AWS/GCP/Azure or Kubernetes deployment
